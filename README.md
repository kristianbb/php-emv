# PHP EMV

A collection of EMV tools and utilities for PHP 5.3+

**This is a fork of Massimo Lombardo's [project][ORIGIN]**

## Installation

The recommended way to install PHP EMV is through [Composer][COMPOSER]:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "kristianbb/php-emv": "@stable"
    }
}
```

**ProTip** -- avoid the `@stable` keyword, [use a proper version tag][PACKAGIST_VERSION] instead.
